# yelp-reviews-nlp
The purpose of the challenge is to classify text or reviews according to the sentiment polarities of opinions i.e. <br />
1. strongly negative (1), 
2. weakly negative (2), 
3. neutral (3), 
4. weakly positive  (4) and 
5. strongly positive (5). <br /> <br />
<!-- end of the list -->
The directory contents of this distribution should as follows: <br />
./ <br />
**reviews_analysis.ipynb** - File containing the source code <br />
**Sentiment Analysis report** - In-depth discussion about the problem with solution and analysis <br /><br />

This file runs the ULMFit model on the input data and predicts the test 
data producing the output file ‘predict_label.csv’ <br />
This is a python-based implementation. The environment used for building it 
was Python 3.6.4 and Google Colab (with GPU).  The notebook can be 
compiled using  using Jupyter Notebook 5.4.0 (64-bit) or higher as well.  
Not that: the code will take hours to build the model and predict with a decent 
GPU.

## Running Instructions  
1. Run all the cells in ‘reviews_analysis.ipynb’ sequentially since input 
of next cell depends on the output of previous cell. 
2. Please download the required libraries before compiling the code 
3. It is a good idea to run the jupyter file in Google Colab rather than using 
any other platform for jupyter notebook or local machine.  <br /><br />

### Input files 
The input data are as follows. These files should be in the same folder as the 
source code file: <br />
./ <br />
**labeled_data.csv** - File containing the labelled data (not included) <br />

This file should contain 2 columns with names 'label','text' with first row 
specifying the column names <br /><br />
**test_data.csv** - File containing the test data (not included) <br />
This file should contain 2 columns ‘test_id’, ‘text’ with first row specifying 
the column names <br />

### Output file 
The output file generated are:  <br />
./ <br />
**predict_label.csv** - File containing the predicted values.<br />
 This file contains the label prediction on the testing data. It contains 2 
columns ‘test_id’, ‘label’ with first row specifying the column names. <br /><br />

The code can be run on Google colab or using a local machine. <br />
1. **Local machine**: The files (‘reviews_analysis.ipynb’, input files) should 
be in one folder and code will run (download the required packages 
beforehand). <br /><br />

2. **Google colab**: <br />
a. The files should be uploaded to google drive in one folder <br />
b. When running the code in colab, uncomment the first block of 
code and give a link to the google drive (already in the code).
